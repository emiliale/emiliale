Hi, Iâ€™m Emilia!

With a master's degree in computer science, I mainly specialize in web application software development. I have experience in developing applications from both the server and client sides. I have done most projects using React on the frontend. I have also worked with the backend framework Django. 

I am familiar with the services offered by Amazon - I worked on a commercial project that used AWS services with Node.js and on a university project with AWS SDK for Java.

Professional experience has given me the skills I need to work with a team, such as using a version control system (GIT), working in an Agile methodology (using Jira, Trello), conducting code reviews, developing software that meets specific customer requirements, performing onboarding and participating in the recruitment process. 

Part of my education was spent on user experience research techniques. As a result, I know how to conduct basic user research and know user needs, which is essential when developing software. 

The master's thesis summarizing my 5-year education is in the area of machine learning and recommendation systems, so these terms are not foreign to me.
